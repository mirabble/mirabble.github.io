#### 👋 Hi ! 
Welcome to my Blog !
In this post I'm going to try to explain what this blog is, why I made it and what I'm going to mostly post on it.

#### ❓ What ?
This website is a blog... it is going to be mostly about programming. I am going to mostly post about the projects that I've done, the process of developing them and the new things that I learn in that process. If you are a programmer or just interested in anything related to that, I guess this blog is suited for you !

#### Why ?
I made this blog mostly for selfish reasons. First things first, I wanted to have someone to listen to me and the things i have to say. I love sharing knowledge. Second of all, I wanted a place to journal all the things I doo. you can be sure I have lost alot of progress through just forgetting my old projects.

#### Where ?
It is hosted on github pages ! I absoloutley love the idea of the integration between a repository manager and a static website hoster ! I decided to go with github pages because of two reasons

1. It is free 🎉
2. I can easily upload content with git 🚀

I am going to try to move this website from github pages to something like a raspberry pi and try to make it fully eco friendly with solar panels ☀️ or something but that's for a later project 😉

#### How ?
I made this website with Astro 🚀 if you are interested in learning astro or you just want to see how I made this website, definetley check out the source code !
The reason I chose Astro was because of these reasons :

1. Static Website Generation
2. Minimalism
3. Fully Compatible With Other Frameworks
4. Unbelievably High Speed
5. Easy Integration With Github Pages
6. Amazing Docs and Tutorials

If you want to make a documentation page or a blog or anything, I suggest you use Astro. I'm not sponsored btw but I just love astro so much. At first I started with a minimal setup and made all of it from scratch with tailwind. but then I realized that it is too much work and at the end it's going to be unoptimized and messy. So I scratched it all and chose to go with the blog template. I just customized it and here we are ! Since it was styled in css I decided to not go with tailwind and coded it all in pure css.

#### Side Note
Most of my blogs are not going to be this short. I will try to make them as informative and useful as possible. so sorry if this one is too short 😄
