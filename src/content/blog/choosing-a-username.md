#### The Problem 
In today's world with more than 6 billion people on the internet there is sureley a shortage of usernames for accounts on all different platforms. even using your name isn't unique enough and you have to add random numbers and letters at the end of your username to make it unique which isn't ideal.
in this post I'm going to share why I decided to change my username, how I did it and what are some other ways that you could do it !

#### Why should you change your username ?
there are many reasons for changing your username. Me personally changed it because my old one wasn't professional enough and was a bit cringy but you may have your own reasons. 

#### The Default Format
There are many ways you could choose a username for yourself but it heavily depends on the context you are intending on using it. <br />
I'm not going to try to make usernames like xX_NinjaSlayer_Xx or some other cringy names like that. the first step is to choose a word that you like. it can be anything. it can be your name, a part of your name, a word that you like or anything. if your name is John Doe, you can use JoDo or even DoJo as the starting word.

##### 1. Gamer
Most of you reading this are probably looking for a gaming username in places like minecraft and xbox gamer tags. most people decide to go with a random name generator. even **Mr.Beast** got his username from xbox gamer tag generator. at first it was **Mr.Beast2000** which he later simplified it to **Mr.Beast**. <br/>
There are many name generators online that you can use . with the AI hype right now they have gotten even better than ever before.
there are some good ones out there like Vaizle but I highly suggest you make it on your own or get help from some llm like chatgpt or deepseek. in the case of the starting word that we chose, lets say jodo ( gotten from John Doe ), we can do many things to it. there are some suffixes and prefixes you can add to that word to make it unique. here's a list of names you could make using jodo :
1. jodox
2. ggjodo
3. jodonoscope
4. jodoslayer
5. jodotron
6. jodobot

and more things like that. for this part I definetley suggest chatgpt and other llms for help.

##### 2. Devleoper
for developers it is the same story but with other suffixes and prefixes. here are some samples :
1. devjodo
2. codingwithjodo
3. jodoio
4. jodosys
5. jodomakes
6. jodostack

##### 3. General
for general users any of the above could be used but there are some certain methods you could use that would make the username unique in every area. here are some samples :
1. jodoism
2. jodog (a play with jodo  and dog)
3. heyjodo
4. iamjodo
5. itsjodo
6. jodontstop

#### What I did
For the starting words I went with a word that I had memories of, Mirab, and then I just added a ble at the end to make sound like a genuine word. i guess it sounds nice but I dont really know. Again I highly suggest you use a tool like Chatgpt or some other chatbot for it, it definetley helps a lot.
Do note that that word can be anything. a word that sounds cool to you, a word you have memories with or as I said, a made up word made with your name. of course you can always go with your name as a username but whats the in that ?
